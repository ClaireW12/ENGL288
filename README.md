## **THE KOALA IS A DEAD END**

Charles Darwin was the first to propose **evolutionary theory**, which describes how evolution is the result of organisms surviving long enough to reproduce
and pass on traits that make others of their specieis more liklely to survive and reproduce; a concept we can quantify as an organism's "fitness". 
The term "survival of the fittest" refers to this, in the sense that according to evolutionary theory, organisms with lower "fitness" willl be less successful
from an evolutionary standpoint in being able to survive and reproduce and thus will likely not stick around over multiple generations as the weaker
traits (and the organisms carrying them) eventually are "weeded out" by **natural selection**. 
> **Natural Selection** desribes the means through which evolution acts upon a population of organisms. 

Therefore, we arrive at the great conundrum that is the Koala (_Phascolarctos cinereus_).  
Discovered in 1798 by European explorer John Price, these furry creatures are not bears but marsupials: a pouched mammal that spends most of its day
sleeping and munching on Eucalyptus leaves. They have since become an enigma when one considers the way in which they make a living, and somehow these 
lazy bags of fluff have evaded natural selection despite having some of the poorest features an animal can have in terms of survival capability. 
Yet it lives on. Perhaps out of spite. 
To further this argument, our points for why the Koala is in fact an evolutionary dead-end and should have been purged from the earth (by means of natural selection) 
are summarized as follows:

* ### Koalas lack intelligence  
Koalas have a "smooth brain" (imagine a brain wihtout the characteristic folds, which normally are credited with acheiving larger surface area relative to 
volume to allow for more neurons and connections). This results in [Koalas' inability to develop higher level recognition and understanding that many 
other animals have](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2017/09/17/koalas-not-the-smartest-tool-in-the-shed/). They don't seem to recognize other Koalas unless they are up close, and therefore don't adopt many of the survival strategies like 
living in pairs or groups that other animal species have for protection from predators. This also poses a severe threat for safety of the Koala, as not
recognizing a predator until it enters your personal space is often too late and leads to a swift death. 

* ### Koalas ONLY eat Eucalyptus leaves  
As in, if there are no Eucalyptus trees around the Koala has virtually no adaptability to other food sources, which is a huge detriment to its survival
since adaptability to different resources allows a species to better withstand changing environmental conditions. They are also incredibly picky when it 
comes to _which_ Eucalyptus trees; [trees must be within a certain distance of the tree it was raised in](https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/wildlife/animals/living-with/koalas/facts) (usually amounts to about a few dozen trees) that 
it will eat leaves off of. This poses a large issue for keeping Koalas in captivity because if Eucalyptus isn't sourced from a tree familiar to the Koala
it will **literally refuse to eat and die**. There is absolutely no advantage to doing this instead, and contributes to high declines of local Koala populations
in the wild if the population becomes too dense and uses up all of the leaves from the preferred trees. 

* ### Eucalytpus leaves are a horrible food source  
If these leaves somewhow were nutritionally dense, then yes, one could argue "why would a Koala ever need to expand its palette?" but no. Eucalyptus leaves
are in fact very low in nutrients and calories, and are highly fiborous; meaning they require a lot of chewing before being swallowed. This requires a lot 
of energy on the Koala's part with very little return for the effort they put in to eating. Compounding with the extra effort required to chew is the effort
to digest these leaves because they are highly toxic to any other animal. The leaves contain a compund called cineole, which if ingested, can cause severe 
neurological symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, shortness of breath, and can lead to coma. [The Koala has a special digestive organ called a _cecum_ ](https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/wildlife/animals/living-with/koalas/facts)
which houses bacteria that allow it to break down these toxins before the Koala feels the effects. But the question remains: Why go through this much trouble?
This is the opposite of efficiency in terms of obtaining nutrition, and plenty of other food sources exist that don't also include a poison.  
The Koala also mainly depends on Eucalyptus leaves for 3/4 of its water supply,and will only resort to drinking actual water in times of extreme drought or 
high stress, which again reiterates its fragility due to its extreme dependence on this one species of tree. 

* ### They have no energy from their terrible diet
Koalas are known to [spend up to 20 hours a day sleeping](https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/wildlife/animals/living-with/koalas/facts) since most of their energy goes towards digesting a mostly-indigestable and posionous diet of Eucalyptus 
leaves. Their lifestyle leaves them with little energy to do anything else, including being aware of their surroundings, which leave them highly open to 
predators like Dingoes and large birds of prey (Hawks and Owls, especially for young Koalas) if they so choose to nap in an area visible or within reach. 
Keeping your guard down for the majority of the day is not a viable strategy for improving your chances of staying alive and avoiding predators, which again
goes against evolutionary theory.

* ### They almost all have Chlamydia
Yes. Although the strains found on Koalas are different from the ones able to infect humans, up to [100% of tested populations of Koalas have chlamydia](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/australia-begins-vaccinating-hundreds-of-koalas-against-chlamydia-in-trial-180978900/). 
The symptoms of chlamydia (severe inflammation and pain with urination, massive cysts and scarring of the reproductive tract) are noted to contribute 
heavily to the decline of Koalas in the wild. Treating chlamydia infection in humans is easy enough with the right antibiotics, but Koalas do not respond 
well to antibiotics since their special gut bacteria is also impacted by the medicine. When the Australian governemnt tested out vaccine programs for Koalas
to try and curb the chlamydia, they found that either their guts were affected too much (to the point where they could't digest Eucalyptus properly and 
started dying from their poisonous leaf diet) or that even if they were successfully cured, they the population was soon re-infected. Its a losing battle,
and here we have another example of natural selection trying to weed out the Koala by means of an STD. 

Its an evolutionary miracle that these creatures are still alive and in numbers great enough to be enjoyed by those who find them cute and cuddly in appearence.
But to all of those who are familiar with the basic principles that govern every other apspect of life, it seems incredulous that these smooth-brained bags 
of disease and toxins have not been removed by means of natural selection that normally act to weed out organisms unable to adapt to its surroundings. To
that point I rest my case: Koalas are a dead-end in terms of evolution.
